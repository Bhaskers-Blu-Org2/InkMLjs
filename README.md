# InkMLjs

## Project Description
The InkML JavaScript library allows InkML digital ink to be refernced within web pages and rendered directly into HTML5 <canvas> tags. Ink Markup Language (InkML) is a W3C standard for encoding digital ink (http://www.w3.org/tr/inkml). 
The Ink Markup Language serves as the data format for representing ink entered with an electronic pen or stylus.   Products such as Microsoft Office 2010 allow users to draw ink directly into Office documents, and the ink is persisted within the documents as InkML.   The InkML JavaScript library allows a web page to render InkML generated by Microsoft Office or any other InkML compliant application.
Below are examples of the same InkML rendered within PowerPoint 2010 and within a web page using the InkML JavaScript library.
